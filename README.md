### Overview
***
* Purpose
  1. The [Depresjon dataset](https://datasets.simula.no/depresjon/) looks at measuring activity of participants with either Bipolar I or II or Unipolar depression and comparing with a control group. Their activity is measured by actigraph, which is similar to a fitness tracker except, instead of steps, it takes snapshots of activity levels throughout the entire day.

The Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) is a ten-item diagnostic questionnaire which psychiatrists use to measure the severity of depressive episodes in patients with mood disorders. 

- includes questions on the following symptoms:
1. Apparent sadness 
2. Reported sadness 
3. Inner tension 
4. Reduced sleep 
5. Reduced appetite 
6. Concentration difficulties 
7. Lassitude 
8. Inability to feel 
9. Pessimistic thoughts 
10. Suicidal thoughts


  * Usual cutoff points are:
  - 0 to 6 – normal /symptom absent
  - 7 to 19 – mild depression
  - 20 to 34 – moderate depression
  - over 34 – severe depression


* Deliverables
  1. Cleaned dataset prepared for ML
  2. Two models to make predictions
  3. An application to take in activity data and MADRS survey
